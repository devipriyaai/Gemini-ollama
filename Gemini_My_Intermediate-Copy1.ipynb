      "3.  **The Rule of 3 (for Dinner):** Aim to include at least one source of **Protein** (chicken, fish, beans), one serving of **Complex Carbs** (quinoa, brown rice, sweet potato), and one source of **Vegetables** (broccoli, salad, roasted roots) at every dinner.\n",

      "#### The Aromatics Base (The \"Mirepoix\")\n",
      "*   1 tablespoon Olive Oil (or butter)\n",
      "*   1 medium Onion, finely chopped\n",
      "*   2 Carrots, peeled and diced\n",
      "*   2 Celery stalks, diced\n",
      "*   2-3 cloves Garlic, minced\n",
      "\n",
      "#### The Main Vegetables\n",
      "*   2 medium Potatoes (or sweet potatoes), peeled and diced\n",
      "*   1 cup Cabbage, shredded or chopped\n",
      "*   1 cup Green Beans, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces\n",
      "*   1/2 cup Peas (fresh or frozen)\n",
      "*   *Optional:* 1/2 cup Mushrooms, sliced\n",
      "*   *Optional:* 1 Zucchini or Yellow Squash, diced\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Liquid and Seasoning\n",
      "*   6 cups Vegetable Broth (low sodium recommended)\n",
      "*   1 (14.5 oz) can Diced Tomatoes, undrained (or 2 fresh medium tomatoes, chopped)\n",
      "*   1 teaspoon Dried Mixed Herbs (such as Italian seasoning or Herbs de Provence)\n",
      "*   1/2 teaspoon Dried Thyme\n",
      "*   1 Bay Leaf\n",
      "*   Salt and freshly ground Black Pepper, to taste\n",
      "\n",
      "#### For Garnishing (Optional)\n",
      "*   Fresh Parsley or Cilantro, chopped\n",
      "*   A squeeze of fresh Lemon juice\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Instructions\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1. Sauté the Aromatics (10 minutes)\n",
      "1.  Heat the olive oil in a large stockpot or Dutch oven over medium heat.\n",
      "2.  Add the chopped onion, diced carrots, and diced celery. Sauté for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent and the vegetables have slightly softened.\n",
      "3.  Add the minced garlic and sauté for another 1 minute until fragrant. Be careful not to burn the garlic.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. Build the Soup Base (5 minutes)\n",
      "1.  Stir in the diced potatoes, dried mixed herbs, dried thyme, and salt and pepper. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring to coat the vegetables with the seasonings.\n",
      "2.  Add the vegetable broth, the canned diced tomatoes (with their juice), and the bay leaf.\n",
      "3.  Bring the soup to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to a simmer. Cover the pot loosely.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. Simmer and Add Remaining Vegetables (20 minutes)\n",
      "1.  Let the soup simmer for about 10 minutes. The potatoes and carrots should be starting to soften.\n",
      "2.  Add the tougher remaining vegetables: the chopped cabbage, green beans, and any optional mushrooms or zucchini.\n",
      "3.  Continue to simmer, uncovered, for another 10-15 minutes, or until all the vegetables (especially the potatoes and carrots) are tender when pierced with a fork.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4. Finish and Serve (5 minutes)\n",
      "1.  In the last 5 minutes of cooking, stir in the peas (if using frozen peas, add them towards the very end so they retain their bright green color).\n",
      "2.  Remove the bay leaf.\n",
      "3.  Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning with additional salt, pepper, or herbs if necessary. A squeeze of lemon juice at this point can brighten the flavor significantly.\n",
      "4.  Ladle the hot soup into bowls. Garnish with fresh chopped parsley or cilantro.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Tips for the Best Vegetable Soup\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Customization:** Feel free to swap vegetables! Good additions include broccoli florets, kale (added in the last 5 minutes), bell peppers, or corn.\n",
      "*   **Heartier Soup:** For added protein, stir in a can of drained and rinsed chickpeas, cannellini beans, or kidney beans during the last 10 minutes of cooking.\n",
      "*   **Blending:** If you prefer a thicker, creamier soup without adding dairy, scoop out about 1 cup of the soup (including some potatoes) and blend it until smooth. Stir the blended mixture back into the pot.\n",
      "*   **Make Ahead:** Vegetable soup tastes even better the next day, as the flavors have time to meld. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.\n",
